So what you can do \\nis let's say plot the square footage of the house against the list price of  the house, right, so \\nyou collect data on a bunch of houses. And let' s say you get a data set like this with \\nhouses of different sizes that are li sted for different amounts of money.  \\nNow, let's say that I'm trying to sell a hous e in the same area as Portland, Oregon as \\nwhere the data comes from. Let's say I have a hou se that's this size in square footage, and \\nI want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for. So there are lots of ways to do this, and some of you may have seen elements of what I'm \\nabout to say before.  \\nSo one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight  line to it. And then \\nif this is my house, you may then look at th e straight line and predict that my house is \\ngonna go for about that much money, right? Ther e are other decisions that we can make,\")"
